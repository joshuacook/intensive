    "#### Programming Method: Transform and Reassign a Variable\n",
    "\n",
    "The programming pattern being used here is one that is fairly common. Here we take some variable, transform that variable, and then reassign the result to the original variable name. In the simplest sense, you might think about doing this with an integer\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_int = 4\n",
    "my_int = my_int + 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    "Of course, this pattern is so common that it has a shortcut that works in most popular programming languages\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_int = 4\n",
    "my_int += 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    "In general, where it is not necessary to keep incremental results of a variable, we use a pattern like this one. For example, you might imagine recording the time that a certain process takes use the `time.time()` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import time\n",
    "start = time.time()\n",
    "# execute some process\n",

    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "elapsed_time_int = int(elapsed_time)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this, you have actually stored two variables `elapsed_time` and `elapsed_time_int`. A better approach would be to simply overwrite the first variable with the change you wish to make\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "elapsed_time = int(elapsed_time)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here you have made use of the transformation and reassignment programming pattern. We cast the time `elapsed_time` as an `int` and reassign this to the original `elapsed_time`, thus only ever storing a single value."

When you write a `DataFrame` to disk as a Pickle you can load it in later, *exactly* as it was when you saved it. Furthermore, just like Pandas has a `pd.read_csv()` method, it also includes the method `pd.read_pickle()` to help you load a Pickled `DataFrame` at some later point."
